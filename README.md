# Simple Keylogger

This project demonstrates a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. The keylogger captures the keys pressed by the user and saves them to a file named `keylog.txt`.

**Important Note**: This keylogger is intended for educational purposes only. Always ensure you have explicit permission to log keystrokes on any system you use this code on. Unauthorized use of keyloggers can be illegal and unethical.

## Features
